# Phase 3 Final Project.

## Electronic Management System.
This is a system that manages the electronic devices in a company.It utilises the basic knowledge of CLI and ORM in order to create a system that manages the electronic devices in a company.

## Requirements
You need to implement a Python CLI Application that meets the following requirements.

## ORM Requirements
The application must include a database created and modified with Python ORM methods that you write.

The data model must include at least 2 model classes.
The data model must include at least 1 one-to-many relationships.
Property methods should be defined to add appropriate constraints to each model class.
Each model class should include ORM methods (create, delete, get all, and find by id at minimum).

## CLI Requirements
The CLI must display menus with which a user may interact.
The CLI should use loops as needed to keep the user in the application until they choose to exit.
For EACH class in the data model, the CLI must include options: to create an object, delete an object, display all objects, view related objects, and find an object by attribute.
The CLI should validate user input and object creations/deletions, providing informative errors to the user.
The project code should follow OOP best practices.
Pipfile contains all needed dependencies and no unneeded dependencies.
Imports are used in files only where necessary.
Project folders, files, and modules should be organized and follow appropriate naming conventions.
The project should include a README.md that describes the application.

## Project Fixtures
1. Add a new electronic item
2. List all electronic items
3. Find an electronic item
4. Delete an electronic item
5. Update an electronic item

## Running the application
To run the application, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your system.
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```
Run the following command to start the application:
``` python cli.py ```

## Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by the need to manage electronic devices in a company.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following files:
1.Cl1.py: The main file that contains the CLI application.
2.Models.py: The file that contains the ORM models for the data model.
3.Fixtures.py: The file that contains the fixtures for the data model.
4.README.md: The file that contains the documentation for the project.

## Conclusion
This project is a CLI application
that manages the electronic devices in a company. It uses Python ORM to create a data model and provides a CLI interface for managing the data.
The project follows OOP best practices and includes a README file that describes the application.
The project is well-organized and follows appropriate naming conventions.
